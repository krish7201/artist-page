# artist-page
## Description
I made a generic artist website out of CSS and Bootstrap 5 for a guy at H&amp;M.  Check it out! :)

## Install
To check out the page, I believe all you've gotta do is
1. install the files (.zip) and unzip them into some folder
2. double click on the .html file, if asked choose your web browser for the application.

## Note
- The images have cool hover transition effects, especially the center image.
- This was hosted on amazon RDS/EC2, but I dropped it because the guy didn't end up following through with this.
